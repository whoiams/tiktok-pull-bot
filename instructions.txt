make sure you have python in PATH!

how to get userid: https://streamable.com/u9fada

1. run "scrape.py" and enter a userid to scrape users from it, the scraped users will be stored in "combo.txt".
2. run "main.py" and enter the name + extension of the combolist (example: combo.txt).
3. let it run and all the data will be saved in "checked.txt".
4. create the emails and reset the password, it won't always be the correct account but you should be able to get some stats (10k+) easily (hotmail & gmail works best).
5. enjoy!
